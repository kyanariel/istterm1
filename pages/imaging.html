      <h4>What is it?</h4>
<p>Digital imaging is the creation and editing of a digital image, such as a physical scene or structure. Digital imaging includes the processing, compression, storage, printing, and display of images. Unlike physical image, such as a film photograph, digital images have the ability make copies, and edit digitally indefinitely without any loss of image quality.</p>
<h4>Dimensions</h4>
<p>Image dimensions are the length and width of a digital image. It is usually measured in pixels, but some graphics programs allow you to view and work with your image in the equivalent inches or centimeters, allowing the image to be printable with right knowledge how large the physical image is. </p>
<p>Depending on what you plan to use your image for you may want to change the image size. For instance, if you are using a high-resolution photograph, you need to make the image dimensions smaller for publishing to a Website. When using a graphics or image-editing program, you will usually have two options for changing the image dimensions resize or resample. Resizing will retain the same number of pixels while modifying the width and height of the image, while resampling is to change  the number of pixels in the image.</p>
<h4>RGB and Bayer Filter</h4>
<p>When a digital camera is activated by pressing the shutter button, light will be picked up in the image. However, it will only show a greyscale, resulting in the need of a filter showing the primary light colours of red, green, and blue (RGB). Filters are arrayed usually in what is called a bayer filter, which is alternating rows of red-green and green-blue filters. There are twice as many greens in the pattern, since the human eye is more sensitive to green light, thus creating a sharper image. Here is a more in depth detail on bayer filters by Computerphile: </p>

<h4>Megapixels</h4>
<p>Megapixel is a unit of graphic resolution where 1 megapixel is worth a million pixels, thus if a camera has 12 megapixels, the camera would produce an image with 4000x3000 pixels, which equals to 12 million pixels. The quality of the camera and lense becomes more important if you are enlarging an image, because any loss of detail or sharpness is magnified. If an image is enlarged too much, it will look "fuzzy" or "pixelated".</p>

<h4>Digital Image Manipulation</h4>
<p>Digital Manipulation software, such as Adobe Photoshop, and Gimp are image editors that allow images to be changed through various methods and techniques to achieve desired results. Results such as removing a person in the background of an image, to completely creating a new world in an image is possible through tools such as the pen, magic wand, slicing, and move tool. Each have unique and different functions to create an image</p>
<h4>GUI of a Digital Image Manipulation software</h4>
<p>Here is a video on how to operate on a digital manipulation GUI by: Flow Graphics</p>
