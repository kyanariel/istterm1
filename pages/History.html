      <h4>Beginnings </h4>
        <p> Camera has a long history dating back to ancient times with the camera obscura or pinhole camera where light will go through a hole and present an upside down image through the back of a box. As the years progressed and technology changed in 1827 Joseph Nicephore Niepce used the camera obscura for coming up with heliographs or sun prints (like a polaroid) creating the first ever photograph. It was only in In 1885, George Eastman developed paper film before he switched to celluloid use in 1889, and called this camera “Kodak” which is still a recognisable brand. During the 20th century, Twin-lense reflex and single-lens reflex cameras were slowly developing becoming more and more commercial for use. Additionally, Polaroid created their signature film known as “polaroids”, which made use of a patented chemical process to come up with finished prints of the photos within just a minute, giving birth to instant cameras. </p>
      <h4> Digital Cameras </h4>
        <p> It was then in the mid 1970s, Kodak invented several solid-state image sensors that convert light to digital pictures instead of film, thus changing the way we use images today. Cameras have progressed a lot through the past 20 years here is an old photo of compact camera from around 20 years ago, which was the camera most non photographers would use, and here is one in today's world, which is simply a smart phone which has both the ability to take pictures, but also used as a device for communication, entertainment, etc. <p>
      <h4> 2000s </h4>
        <p> During the 2000s, electronic devices started becoming more and more digitised, and makers of cameras and camcorder are constantly developing products that are increasingly lighter weight, easier-to-use and offer greater levels of picture quality. Many companies, such as Canon were innovating all aspects of digital imaging, including the optical, control and processing realms. This resulted in consumers to have a high demand in digital cameras to be easier to use, and processing and sharing of images be simplified. Moreover, cameras became more and more compact and their technology constantly improved, with camera sensors increasingly improving quality, and pocket sized cameras having optical zoom that has a 4X optical zoom lens with a large aperture range and a 12 megapixel sensor.</p>
      <h4> 2010s and Now </h4>
        <p> In the 2010s, camera’s increasingly improved their simplicity for the consumers, allowing not only professionals, but everyone to have the ability to produce images that are high quality. In addition, lense technology constantly improved, surpassing megapixel threshold and became more and more compact. With that, smartphone camera technology, also improved with companies such as Xiaomi creating the 108 megapixel camera. As the years past, we are able to produce high quality images with a small and lightweight device, known as the smartphone, and be able to process and share our images at incredibly high speeds.</p>

  <h4> Function </h4>
<p> A camera is a device which will capture an image or video, and stores them in digital memory or film. All cameras essentially work by having a box with a small hole that captures light, and will be enhanced through the use of lenses, filters, and sensors. DSLR (Digital Single Lense Camera), is a technology that revolutionised the way we would capture. Here are main parts that make it work: </p>
  <h4> Memory card slot </h4>
  <p> Is a slot that allows you to insert a secure digital memory card into a computer printer or other device. Digital cameras store pictures as data files rather than on film the size of your memory determines the number you can take before downloading the to your computer.
  </p>
   <h4> Flash </h4>
  <p> Is a tool used by cameras to create light. In DSLRs it is found as bracket on top of a light stand that holds a speed light can also be called a flash bracket,  the metal piece on the top or the side of the camera allows the photographer to change angles.
  </p>
  <h4> Lens </h4>
  <p>  Is an optical device used in cameras to focus or disperse a light beam through refraction, allowing the image to be seen by the camera sensor.
  </p>
  <h4> Sensor </h4>
  <p> Is the device inside a digital camera to capture the light required to form a digital image. Most common form of sensor is a CCD (Charged Coupled Device), which captures a high quality images.
  </p>
  <h4> Filter </h4>
  <p>  Is a tools used by photographers to alter the appearance of an image, by attaching a lense over the camera’s lense, thus having the ability to have more contrast, or less glare. For more information check the filters section.
  </p>
  <h4> Focusing ring  </h4>
  <p>  Is a ring on the lenses body, which moves the lens elements. By adjusting the position of the lense, the image produced by the lens can be brought into clear focus.
  </p>
  <h4> Shutter </h4>
  <p>  Is the device that allows light to pass through the lense. It can open and close quickly for images that have fast motion like birds flying, but can also open and close slowly for a different effect on the image.
