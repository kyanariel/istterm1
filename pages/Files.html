      <h4>Types of Images</h4>
<p>There are many file types for images, resulting in many ways to use images in websites, documents, and print. Images are either are in a RAW image format, which is the file that would appear if you take a picture until it will become a raster or vector. Rasters are measured in pixels, while vectors use proportional formulas removing the factor of image quality being lost.
Raster Images</p>
<h4>Raster Images</h4>
<p>are constructed by pixels which form an image known as JPEG, GIF, and PNG. Pixels in an image have a defined proportion due to their resolution, resulting in an image being enlarged will create a distorted image (blurry and unclear)</p>
<p><b>JPG or JPEG</b> - Stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, they are the most common file type that is used in websites and documents, like Microsoft Word, and Google Slides. If a JPEG is compressed, the quality of the image decreases as the file size decreases. This is known as a “lossy”.</p>
<p><b>PNG</b> - Stands for Portable Network Graphics, are another common file type that is suited for interactive websites, and presentations, like Microsoft Powerpoint, and Google Slides, due to the fact they have transparent background. They are known as "lossless", meaning you can edit them and not lose quality.</p>


<a class="sideimg"><img src="../images/alarm.png" alt="ringring" width="400px"></a>
        <div class="small">PNGs have transparen backgrounds</div>



<p><b>GIF</b> - Stands for Graphics Interchange Format, GIFs are animated file types which are good for websites as it can show an animated visual to the user of the website. However, animations are very limited, since there are 256 colors in the RGB colorspace (unlike the usual 16777216 combinations), but the limited number of colors, result in a lower file size.</p>
<h4>Vector Images</h4>

        <div class="small">Comparison of a vector and raster image if it was scaled up</div>
<p><b>Vector Images</b> - Vector images are more flexible, because constructed using proportional formulas rather than pixels. Vectors are used for creating graphics that require frequent resizing like a logo. Some examples are EPS, AI and PDF.</p>
<p><b>TIFF</b> - Stands for Tagged Image File, and is a raster file, resulting in the quality to not drop, because original image data is maintained regardless of how often you might copy, re-save, or compress the original file. This is known as "lossless compression". These files are used when saving photographs for print, but not websites, since it will take too long</p>
<p><b>PSD</b> - Stands for Photoshop Document, and is a files that is created and saved in Adobe Photoshop. This type of file contains "layers" that make modifying the image much easier to handle.  Furthermore, other digital manipulation software, such as Gimp will also have their version of a PSD known as XCF</p>
<p><b>PDF</b> - Stands for Portable Document Format, which is a file type created by Adobe and is usually used for documents but can also be used for images, allowing users universal to access the file without an application, on any device.</p>
<p><b>EPS</b> - Stands for Encapsulated Postscript, which is a filetype that is like PDFs where it is a universal application, but is used by designers that are not utilizing Adobe products, but may be using Corel Draw or Quark.</p>
<p><b>AI</b> - Stands for Adobe Illustrator Document, which is a file type commonly used by designers as it can be used for websites and print, and produces vector artwork, the easiest type of file to manipulate.</p>
