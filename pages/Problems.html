      <h4>Overview</h4>
  <p>Since the first cameras, many problems have occured and different advances in technology have tried to solve these issues. With the release of dslr cameras, they are still not perfect tools, as a result like any hardware device, there are solutions to solve these problems.</p>
  <h4>Problems and how to solve it</h4>
  <p><b>Blur</b> - Photos are blurred because your camera was unable to accurately focus on the subject, due to the camera shaking or the shutter speed not being able to pick up the image. To fix this, you either have to fix the way you are holding the camera in order not to shake, improve the lighting in order to have a clear image, or adjust your shutter speed to pick up that image, or have a slower shutter speed to use that motion to create a different image.</p>

          <div class="small">blur was created due to camera shaking</div>

  <p><b>Shutter speed with long exposure shots</b> - long exposure shots work by having a slower shutter speed, allowing light to be exposed and create a motion blur effect. However, sometimes a slower shutter speed may seem insufficient, so make the aperture more narrow, or put a neutral density filter, improving the motion blur of an image</p>
  <p><b>Lighting too bright or dark</b> - Since cameras are not human eyes, they will occasionally at times capture an image that is too bright or too dark. To fix this, you can adjust your position, where lighting is best, adjust the exposure setting, use a camera filter, or simply edit the image afterwards.</p>
  <p><b>Image not sharp</b> -  Images can appear soft due to the aperture, and shutter speed. To fix this, do not put the aperture too low, since it will cause diffraction making it look fuzzy, and adjust the shutter speed to be quicker if you are taking pictures of moving objects.</p>
  <p><b>Red eyes</b> - Red eyes are caused only when photos are taken in low light conditions using a flash, so fix the lighting of the room, and tell the people not to directly look into the lense.</p>
